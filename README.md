# 1) Premise: 
Not all of single-cell ATAC-seq biomedical molecular epigenetics is done in human and mouse genomes where there are 
high quality genomes and gene annotations. For the other species that are still highly relevant to study health and disease, 
here are some ArchR annotations to enable less frustration to have snATAC-seq data analyzed with ArchR. 

# 2) Strategy for gene annotations:
